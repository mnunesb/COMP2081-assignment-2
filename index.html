          <h3>The New York Times</h3>
          <p>A tremendously entertaining work of historical fiction, and the basis for the television series of the same name on Netflix.  I originally read this novel in 2005, and after watching the TV series which I thoroughly enjoyed, I am reading it again for a second time, and enjoying it even more the second time.  Cornwell's description of the kingdoms of what is now England is fascinating and full of detail but the character development is the most intriguing aspect of the book(s) as it is easy to get wrapped up in the characters of Uhtred, Ragnar, Alfred and Leofric and many others.  If you like historical fiction you most likely will really enjoy this book and the whole series.</p>

        <h3>Oprah Book Club</h3>
        <p>The Last Kingdom was an extremely enjoyable historical fiction read that features excellent drama, well-realised characters, and is chock-full of memorable battles and duels. The pacing is great too and at the more heated moments, I almost felt like I was part of the battle bellowing “shield wall!” with the sweat, blood, gore and death dripping from the pages. I am so glad that I started Uhtred’s story. With there being 13 books in The Last Kingdom/ The Warrior Chronicles/ The Saxon Stories series I am aiming to read one a month for the foreseeable future. I’d like to thank Edward Gwynne for recommending this series to me.</p>

                    Sharpe is set during the Napoleonic wars. It is the story of Richard Sharp, who was raised in a foundling home, survived in the gutter and worked his way up the ranks to be promoted, uncharacteristically for the time, to an officer in the British Army. Each and every book is superbly researched to implant the fictional Sharpe and his comrades, into very real settings and events from history. These events usually follow quite closely the British Army of the time, as commanded by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

                    <p> The Warlord Chronicles is a 3 volume telling of the Arthur story narrated by a new character, Arthur's friend and captian Derfel. Derfel, as a youth, becomes a spearman in Arthur's warband and is present for all the triumphs and failures of Arthur's career.

                        The Arthurian legends are interpreted here to give them new life and richness. Lancelot becomes a vain, cowardly, glory - seeking king who betrays Arthur in every way possible. Guinevere is an intelligent, ambitious woman whose competency is shackled by her sex. Morgaine and Nimue are at first rivals in assisting Merlin and Arthur, and who later become Arthur's enemies, although they remain divided by religion after Morgaine becomes a Christian. Merlin himself is the most powerful of Druids, whose obsession with the return of the gods ultimately provokes his downfall.

                    <p>This brisk novel by the popular author of Sharpe's Devil follows the adventures of Nathaniel Starbuck, the rebellious and discredited son of a famous Boston abolitionist preacher. Nate flees the North after helping a femme fatale steal money she claimed was hers, winding up in Richmond as Fort Sumter falls and the Civil War begins. Unable to return home, distrusted by Southerners because of his parentage, Nate is taken under the wing of the mercurial and megalomaniacal Washington Faulconer, obsessed with building an independent army, answerable only to him, to fight for the Confederacy. Spanning the period from Sumter's capitulation in April 1861 to the First Battle of Bull Run in July, the book is well paced and filled with the historical details genre fans demand.

                <p>Bernard Cornwell was born in London in 1944 – a ‘warbaby’ – whose father was a Canadian airman and mother in Britain’s Women’s Auxiliary Air Force.</p>
                <p>He was adopted by a family in Essex who belonged to a religious sect called the Peculiar People (and they were), but escaped to London University and, after a stint as a teacher, he joined BBC Television where he worked for the next 10 years.</p>
                <p>He began as a researcher on the Nationwide programme and ended as Head of Current Affairs Television for the BBC in Northern Ireland. It was while working in Belfast that he met Judy, a visiting American, and fell in love. Judy was unable to move to Britain for family reasons so Bernard went to the States where he was refused a Green Card. He decided to earn a living by writing, a job that did not need a permit from the US government – and for some years he had been wanting to write the adventures of a British soldier in the Napoleonic wars – and so the Sharpe series was born. Bernard and Judy married in 1980, are still married, still live in the States and he is still writing Sharpe.</p>
