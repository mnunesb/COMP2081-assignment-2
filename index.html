                    Sharpe is set during the Napoleonic wars. It is the story of Richard Sharp, who was raised in a foundling home, survived in the gutter and worked his way up the ranks to be promoted, uncharacteristically for the time, to an officer in the British Army. Each and every book is superbly researched to implant the fictional Sharpe and his comrades, into very real settings and events from history. These events usually follow quite closely the British Army of the time, as commanded by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

                    <p> The Warlord Chronicles is a 3 volume telling of the Arthur story narrated by a new character, Arthur's friend and captian Derfel. Derfel, as a youth, becomes a spearman in Arthur's warband and is present for all the triumphs and failures of Arthur's career.

                        The Arthurian legends are interpreted here to give them new life and richness. Lancelot becomes a vain, cowardly, glory - seeking king who betrays Arthur in every way possible. Guinevere is an intelligent, ambitious woman whose competency is shackled by her sex. Morgaine and Nimue are at first rivals in assisting Merlin and Arthur, and who later become Arthur's enemies, although they remain divided by religion after Morgaine becomes a Christian. Merlin himself is the most powerful of Druids, whose obsession with the return of the gods ultimately provokes his downfall.

                    <p>This brisk novel by the popular author of Sharpe's Devil follows the adventures of Nathaniel Starbuck, the rebellious and discredited son of a famous Boston abolitionist preacher. Nate flees the North after helping a femme fatale steal money she claimed was hers, winding up in Richmond as Fort Sumter falls and the Civil War begins. Unable to return home, distrusted by Southerners because of his parentage, Nate is taken under the wing of the mercurial and megalomaniacal Washington Faulconer, obsessed with building an independent army, answerable only to him, to fight for the Confederacy. Spanning the period from Sumter's capitulation in April 1861 to the First Battle of Bull Run in July, the book is well paced and filled with the historical details genre fans demand.
